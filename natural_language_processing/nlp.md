# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

## Objective
The main goal of NLP is to process and analyze natural language data, enabling machines to perform tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text generation.

## Key Concepts

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization (splitting text into words/tokens)
   - Stopword removal
   - Lemmatization/Stemming
   - Part-of-speech tagging

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
   - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
   - Contextual Embeddings (BERT, GPT)

3. **Common Tasks**:
   - Text Classification
   - Named Entity Recognition
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Machine Translation
   - Text Generation
   - Question Answering

4. **Deep Learning in NLP**:
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   - Transformers
   - Attention Mechanisms
